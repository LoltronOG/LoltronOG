- 👋 Hi, I’m @LoltronOG
- I’m interested in mainly web development(full stack).
- I like to build apps with python, java and c++. 
- I’m currently learning full stack web development.
- Currently, I'm learing alot as I'm exploring the vast field of web development. 
- My goal is to build a few web applications using the full stack web development knowledge that I'll gain and then later switch to mainly front-end or back-end web development based off preferance.
